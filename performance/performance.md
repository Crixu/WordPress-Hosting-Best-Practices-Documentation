## Caching
WordPress can handle a lot of complex functionality but this comes at a cost. Tasks such as processing PHP, querying the database and collecting information from external APIs all take resources and time. Caching is simply saving the result of these potentially heavy tasks and reusing those results rather than calculating them again. Caches typically expire after a certain amount of time and are regenerated so the most recent content is displayed. When items are served from cache they have a faster response time, usually coming from memory, and take load off the server.
